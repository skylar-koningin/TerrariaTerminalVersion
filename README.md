# Terraria Terminal Version
THIS IS NOT THE FULL TERRARIA GAME! It is a small-scale port of all of the main bosses and Ocram in a text-based game.
I just wanted to make a silly game that's based off of one of my favorite games of all time

## HOW TO PLAY
- install Ruby (**NOT RUBY ON RAILS**); this can be done via your system's package manager or from https://ruby-lang.org

- when you do that, download the newest version from the releases (this could potentially get really old, assuming if terraria doesn't add any more bosses)

- extract it anywhere, but do not move any of the files out or it will break the game

- open a terminal, navigate to the folder, then run `ruby MainMenu.rb`
